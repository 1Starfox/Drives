/**
 * Package {@code robot} is the core package of the library, drawing from
 * all of the other packages to control the robot.
 *
 * This package will handle commands, subsystems, communications with motors,
 * and more.  The Robot class will be within this package, implementing
 * IterativeRobot from WPILib and serving as the main class of the robot code.
 *
 * In most cases, code should be modularized and kept out of the {@code robot}
 * package as much as possible to allow reusability in the future.
 * However, if it is specific to this year's challenge, does not fit within
 * any of the other packages, and only solves a certain problem specific to
 * the challenge (and not a general improvement), place it within the
 * {@code robot} package.
