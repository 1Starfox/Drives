/**
 * Package {@code swerve} contains {@code SwerveDrive.java}, an extension of
 * the {@code Drive} interface, it's implementations, and some helper classes.
 *
 * Swerve drive is a technically complex drive base, with all four wheels
 * having full 360deg rotation abilities.  There are 8 motors total, and
 * each swerve module's (a pair of two motors) speed and rotation must be
 * coordinated perfectly in order to be an effective drive base.
 *
 * TODO: Possibly turn {@code SwerveDrive.java} into an abstract class so that
 * the calculations are reusable for future versions of swerve.
