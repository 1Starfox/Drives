/**
 * Package {@code drive} contains reusable implementations for drive bases.
 *
 * With exception to Drive.java, files should not be placed directly in the
 * {@code drive} package.  Instead, place it within a subpackage based on the
 * type of drive the code is implementing.
 *
 * For example, the {@code swerve} package contains a SwerveDrive-specific
 * extension of the Drive interface, and all swerve drive implementations must
 * implement that interface. This is to ensure that all swerve drive code,
 * no matter what year or what variety, is compatible with the rest of the
 * robot code.
